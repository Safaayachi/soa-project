This is the README file for an e-commerce website project that utilizes microservices architecture. The project consists of two microservices, one for product management and another for user management. The communication between these microservices is facilitated using gRPC, and the website can be accessed through GraphQL or REST APIs.

Project Structure
The project is structured into two main microservices:

Product Management Microservice: This microservice is responsible for managing the products in the e-commerce system. It handles operations such as adding new products, updating existing products, retrieving product information, and handling inventory management.

User Management Microservice: This microservice focuses on user management functionalities. It includes features like user registration, authentication, user profile management, and handling user-related operations.

Both microservices are designed to communicate with each other using gRPC, a high-performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework. This enables efficient and reliable communication between the microservices.

APIs
The e-commerce website provides two options for accessing the functionality:

GraphQL API: The website exposes a GraphQL API that allows clients to query and manipulate data efficiently using a single endpoint. With GraphQL, clients can request specific data structures and reduce over-fetching or under-fetching of information.

REST API: Additionally, the website also offers a RESTful API for compatibility and integration with existing systems. The REST API follows the standard HTTP request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and endpoints are designed to correspond to specific resources and operations.

Setup and Deployment
To set up and deploy the e-commerce website, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository from the designated source.

Install the required dependencies for each microservice by navigating to their respective directories and running the appropriate package manager commands (e.g., npm install or yarn install).

Configure the connection settings for the microservices, such as database credentials, gRPC endpoints, and authentication mechanisms. This information is usually found in the configuration files (e.g., config.js or appsettings.json) or environment variables.

Start the microservices by running the startup commands for each service. Typically, this involves running npm start or yarn start from the root directory of each microservice.

Once the microservices are running, the e-commerce website should be accessible through the defined GraphQL and REST API endpoints. Clients can utilize tools such as GraphQL clients (e.g., Apollo Client) or standard HTTP libraries to interact with the APIs.

Conclusion
This e-commerce website project utilizes microservices architecture with gRPC communication and provides access through GraphQL and REST APIs. By separating product management and user management into distinct microservices, the system achieves scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. Developers can easily extend or modify functionalities independently while ensuring efficient communication between the microservices.
